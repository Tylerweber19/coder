# code
I’ve added a set of ancillary code artifacts into the file , including:

Dockerfile for environment setup (AFL, LLVM, Valgrind, SonarScanner, Semgrep).
requirements.txt listing Python dependencies.
Makefile to build, lint, test, and run the pipeline.
GitHub Actions CI config to automate linting and testing.
prompts.json with structured LLM prompt templates.
These files form a foundation for reproducible experimentation and CI/CD integration.

I’ve added in TestScript.py:

Unit tests (tests/test_generate_inputs.py and tests/test_analysis.py) using pytest, which validate input generation and metric-loading functions.
A notebook generator script (scripts/generate_notebook_template.py) that creates a Jupyter Notebook skeleton for visualizing crash frequencies and static analysis heatmaps.
These artifacts complement your CI pipeline and provide a ready-made template for analysis workflows.
