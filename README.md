# code
Iâ€™ve added a set of ancillary code artifacts, including:

Dockerfile for environment setup (AFL, LLVM, Valgrind, SonarScanner, Semgrep).
requirements.txt listing Python dependencies.
Makefile to build, lint, test, and run the pipeline.
GitHub Actions CI config to automate linting and testing.
prompts.json with structured LLM prompt templates.
These files form a foundation for reproducible experimentation and CI/CD integration.
